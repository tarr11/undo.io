Project TODO:

TASK: IMPORT TEXT FILE
	Import text file and write an RSpec test
	Can we create a unique hash or must we create a GUID?
		Unique hash would be simpler
			Hash(filename) + DateRevision? Blech
		GUID would obvoiusly work
	Store in TodoLine table (user_id:integer, task:string, Guid:GUID, Todo_file_id:integer)
	Read todo lines from previous file with the same name
		(if no file, then insert everything as new)
		
	New file compares each line (without the GUID to the old line)
		If line exists, then append existing GUID for that line
		If line doesn't exist, create a new GUID 
		Create insert commands for new, then also delete commands for removed
		Don't try to see if a line "changed" - either different or the same
		Date of task is date of file when it is inserted
