How do we construct paths?
i want it to work on both filesystems, and URLs
this is the best one for now:
/path/to/file
/path/to/file_replies/
/path/to/file_replies/jamy/1


/path/to/file
/path/to/file/replies
if a file exists, we show it
you can force directory view with /path/to/file?view=directory
if not, we show a directory
i don't like this

/path/to/file2
/path/to/file2_replies/
/path/to/_file2/replies (that's ugly)




OR:
/path/to/file
/path/to/file?replies=jamy

OR:
path/to/file
path/to/file/replies
if there is a replies directory, 


OR:
everything is a directory, with 1 file in it (weird)
/path/to/file -> /path/to/file/index
/path/to/file/replies/jamy/1 ->
